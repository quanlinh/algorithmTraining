            Hi, my name is Quan The Tran. I am a recently graduated student at the University of Washington on Seattle Campus.
            <br/> My passion for working is solving problems that affect people life. I strongly believe in hard work, disciplines,
            ability
            <br/> to learn by continues skills will overcome any obstacle both in life and careers.

        <h3>Project Currently working: </h3>
        <ul>
            <h4>Algorithm and Data structures written in Java Language.</h4>
            <p>
                In this project, I implement the most tackle and well know Algorithm by Java Language, as well as
                <br/> study the correctness and running time!

            <h4>Algorithm and Data structures written in C/C++ Language.</h4>
            <p>
                In this project, I implement the most tackle and well know Algorithm by C++ Language, as well as make a totally testing and
                running the whole
                <br/> project at once.
                <br/> In study the correctness and running time! Different than Java, C++
                <br/> usually faster, but it gets complicate syntax but powerfull Object Oriented Language of speed id key approach.
