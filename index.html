            Hi, my name is Quan The Tran. I am a recently graduated student at the University of Washington on Seattle
            Campus.
            <br /> My passion for working is solving problems that affect people life. I strongly believe in hard work,
            disciplines,
            ability
            <br /> to learn by continues skills will overcome any obstacle both in life and careers.
        </p>
        <h2>Project I Am Currently Working: </h2>
        <ul>
            <h4>Algorithm and Data structures written in Java Language.</h4>
            <p>
                In this project, I implement the most tackle and well know Algorithm by Java Language, as well as
                <br /> study the correctness and running time!
            </p>

        </ul>
        <ul>
            <h4>Algorithm and Data structures written in C/C++ Language.</h4>
            <p>
                In this project, I implement the most tackle and well know Algorithm by C++ Language, as well as make a
                totally testing and
                running the whole
                <br /> project at once.
                <br /> In study the correctness and running time! Different than Java, C++
                <br /> usually faster, but it gets complicate syntax but powerfull Object Oriented Language of speed id
                key approach.

            <h4>Algorithm and Data structures written in Python Language.</h4>
            <p>
                In this project, I implement the most tackle and well know Algorithm by Python Language, as well as
                make a
                <br /> totally testing and running the whole project at once.
                <br /> In study the correctness and running time!
                <br /> Python is so productive to code and learn, the only downsize is speed!

        <h2>Project I Was Working On The Past: </h2>
        <ul>
            <h4>Capstone School project on diversify for UW Students </h4>
            <p>
                I and 2 other designer and 1 software developer build a sculpture
                <br/> to help other student aware of current eviroment.

            <h4> Data Visualization on The Shortest-Splitline Algorithm for Gerrymandering
            </h4>
            <p>
                I and 2 other software developer build  great Algorithm Visualization on 
                <br/> Gerrymandering to help other student learn Algorithm by interactive Visualization.
